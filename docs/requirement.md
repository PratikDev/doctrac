# Doctor Tracker – Project Specification

## 1. Project Overview

Doctor Tracker is a secure administrative web application that allows authenticated users to manage doctors and their corresponding patients. The system focuses on performance optimization, clean UX, and data visualization.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Authentication

* Only authenticated users can access the portal.
* Implement secure login functionality.
* Protect all routes using proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 2.2 Doctor Management

Admin can:

* Create a doctor with the following information:

  * Name
  * Specialization
  * Hospital
  * Phone
  * Email
* View a list of all doctors.
* Search doctors.
* Filter doctors:

  * Date-wise
  * Other relevant filters
* Paginate doctor records.
* View corresponding patients for each doctor.
* Add new patients under a specific doctor.
* Delete patients from the doctor's patient list.

### 2.3 Patient Management

#### Dedicated Patient Page

* List all patients.
* Edit patient information.
* Delete patients.
* Implement:

  * Pagination
  * Search functionality
  * Filtering:

    * Date-wise
    * Patient condition
    * Other relevant filters

## 3. Dashboard & Data Visualization

Admin Dashboard should include:

* Visual representation of data.
* Analytics such as:

  * Total doctors
  * Total patients
  * Patients per doctor
  * Date-based statistics
* Charts and graphs (any suitable analytics library may be used).

### Focus Areas

* Clean data aggregation
* Optimized query performance
* Meaningful visual insights

## 4. UI/UX Requirements

* The UI must be modern and visually appealing.
* Demonstrate strong frontend skills.

### Ensure

* Clean layout
* Proper spacing and hierarchy
* Responsive design
* Smooth navigation
* Good user experience (UX best practices)

### Navigation

Clear navigation between:

* Dashboard
* Doctors
* Patients

## 5. Performance & Optimization

Optimize database queries for:

* Searching
* Filtering
* Pagination

### Best Practices

* Proper indexing in MongoDB
* Efficient query patterns
* Avoid unnecessary re-renders
* Clean folder structure
* Reusable components
* API validation and error handling

## 6. Tech Stack

The project must be implemented using:

* **Frontend:** Next.js (separate client application)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express (separate standalone server)
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **API:** RESTful API design principles (frontend communicates with backend over REST endpoints)
* **Proper state management and data fetching strategies**

## 7. Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated based on:

* Code structure and cleanliness
* Query optimization
* UX/UI quality
* Data visualization implementation
* Performance efficiency
* Authentication implementation
* Use of best practices in Next.js and MongoDB
* Scalability considerations

## 8. README Requirements

The `README.md` is the primary technical documentation. It must include:

| Section                 | Requirement                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**         | A one-paragraph "Elevator Pitch" for the app's purpose.                            |
| **Setup Guide**         | Step-by-step local installation. Must include an `.env.example` file.              |
| **System Architecture** | A high-level overview of the data flow and service interactions.                   |
| **Technical Decisions** | Deep dive into 2 specific decisions (e.g., "Why we chose Redux over Context API"). |
| **Visual Evidence**     | High-quality screenshots of the UI (Desktop & Mobile views).                       |
